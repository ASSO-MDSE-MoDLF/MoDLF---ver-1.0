MoDLF is part of BUMBLE and MoDev projects and developed through the collaboration of Automated Software language and SOftware engineering (ASSO) research group, MÃ¤lardalen University, Sweden and Model Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) research group, NUST, Pakistan.
The repository contains following artifacts/ source code:
1) MoDLF M2 level MetaModel based on ECore developed using Obeo 11.5.
2) M1 Level Tree Editor.
3) Customized M1 Level graphical editor dveloped using Sirius for modeling deep convnet architectures.
4) Two Acceleo projects for Model to Text Transformation to generate executable MATLAB and Python (Keras) code.
5) A user manual for using the graphical workbench, designing architectures and generating code.(To be provided later)
6) High resolution images of the accompanying research paper 
7) Complete projects and source code for all files
